Temperature Spectrometer

This is an embedded digital temperature spectrometer with logging capabilities. The system was based on the NXP mbed LPC1768 platform. The microcontroller used in the temperature logger is based on the 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller with 512 kB flash and 64 kB SRAM. The microcontroller was connected to a TMP102 temperature sensor using an I2C interface and to an LCD screen using an SPI interface. The system supports real-time temperature spectrum computation and control and data export through an on-board USB UART connection.
